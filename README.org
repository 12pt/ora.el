* Ora
Rearrange the defuns in your project's files.

** Usage
Call =ora-up= or =ora-down= to move defuns up and down. Note that moving a defun will move nearby comments above it, should the point be on the first character of the defun. To avoid simply don't move a function when the point is on the first character of the first line.

*** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<M-down>") 'ora-down)
(global-set-key (kbd "<M-up>") 'ora-up)
#+END_SRC

** Notes
Work in progress, caveat emptor.
